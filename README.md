Object Detection and Tracking

Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using PyTorch and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect and track objects in video streams, with a focus on autonomous driving applications.

Features:

  Real-time object detection using PyTorch and the SSD (Single Shot Detector) algorithm
  
  Object tracking using the Kalman filter algorithm
  
  Support for multiple object classes (e.g., cars, pedestrians, bicycles)
  
  Integration with OpenCV for video processing and visualization
  

Requirements:

  PyTorch 1.9.0 or later
  
  OpenCV 4.5.2 or later
  
  Python 3.8 or later
  
  Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (for Windows users)

Segmentation

Overview

This project implements a semantic segmentation model using PyTorch and the U-Net architecture. The model is trained on the Waymo Open Dataset and is designed to segment objects in images, such as roads, lanes, pedestrians, cars, and buildings.

Features

Semantic segmentation using PyTorch and the U-Net architecture

Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset

Supports multi-class segmentation

Includes data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning

Visualizes segmentation results using Matplotlib
