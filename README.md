Object Detection and Tracking

Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection and tracking system using PyTorch and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect and track objects in video streams, with a focus on autonomous driving applications.

Features:
  Real-time object detection using PyTorch and the SSD (Single Shot Detector) algorithm
  Object tracking using the Kalman filter algorithm
  Support for multiple object classes (e.g., cars, pedestrians, bicycles)
  Integration with OpenCV for video processing and visualization

Requirements:
  PyTorch 1.9.0 or later
  OpenCV 4.5.2 or later
  Python 3.8 or later
  Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (for Windows users)
