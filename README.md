Road Understanding with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning

This project demonstrates how to use a custom CNN model alongside transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet50 model to perform road understanding tasks on a dataset (e.g., the Waymo dataset). The code includes data augmentation techniques, model architecture, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Introduction

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a road understanding model using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning from the pre-trained ResNet50 model. The goal is to classify images from a road dataset into various categories (e.g., road types, obstacles) while utilizing data augmentation for improved generalization.
Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

bash

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib opencv-python numpy

Additional Requirements:

    Python 3.7+
    CUDA (optional for GPU acceleration)

Dataset

The dataset used for this project should contain road-related images with corresponding labels. Update the root_dir argument in the RoadUnderstandingDataset class to point to your dataset. You can use datasets such as the Waymo Open Dataset.
Model Architecture

The code contains two models:

    Custom CNN Model:
        Two convolutional layers followed by max-pooling.
        Two fully connected layers for classification.

    Transfer Learning with ResNet50:
        Pre-trained ResNet50 model with a frozen backbone.
        Custom classification head with two fully connected layers for road understanding.

Data Augmentation

To enhance generalization, the following augmentations are applied:

    Random horizontal flipping.
    Random rotation.
    Random resized crop.
    Color jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue adjustments).

These augmentations are implemented using torchvision.transforms.
Training

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. During each epoch, the loss is minimized, and the model's parameters are updated. Training happens for a total of 10 epochs.

python

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

Example Training Loop:

python

for epoch in range(10):
    for images, labels in data_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the validation dataset by computing the accuracy of predictions:

python

model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    total_correct = 0
    for images, labels in data_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
        total_correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()
    accuracy = total_correct / len(dataset)
    print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')

Result Visualization

You can visualize the results by overlapping predicted labels on top of the original images. This is helpful for understanding how the model performs on sample images.

python

def visualize_results(image, label):
    image = image.permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()
    label = label.permute(1, 2, 0).numpy()
    plt.imshow(image)
    plt.imshow(label, alpha=0.5)
    plt.show()

Usage
To run the project:

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-understanding.git
cd road-understanding

    Prepare your dataset and modify the path in the code:

python

dataset = RoadUnderstandingDataset(root_dir='path/to/waymo/dataset', transform=transform)

    Train the model:

bash

python train.py

    Evaluate the model:

bash

python evaluate.py

    Visualize the results:

bash

python visualize.py

Sample image testing:

You can test the model on a sample image as follows:

python

image = torchvision.load_image('path/to/sample/image.jpg')
image = transform(image)
image = image.unsqueeze(0).to(device)
output = model(image)
label = torch.argmax(output, 1)
visualize_results(image, label)
